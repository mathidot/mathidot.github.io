# Basic C

For C, generally a two part process of compiling source files(.c) to object files(.o), then linking the .o files into executables.

## C Pre-Processor(CPP)

* C source files first pass through "macro preprocessor", before compiler sees code 
* CPP commands begins with "#"
  * #include "file.h"  // **Inserts** file.h into output
  * #include <stdio.h> // Looks for file in standard location
  * define M_PI 3.14  // Define constant
  * #if / #endif // Conditional inclusion of text

## Structs in C

```c
typedef struct{
    int length_in_seconds;
    int year_recorded;
}Song
```

### Switch

```C
switch(expressions){
    case const1: statements
    case const2: statements
        default: statements
}
```

## What evaluates to FALSE in C

* 0(integer)
* NULL(a special kind of pointer that is also 0: more on this later)
* No explicit Boolean type in old-school C
  * Often u see #define bool (int)
  * Then #define false 0
  * Alternative approach: include a header file #include <stdbool.h> to provide a boolean type
* Basically anything where all the bits are 0 is false

## Our Tip of the Day.. Valgrind

* Valgrind 
* Use a <= instead of a  < in initializing an array in a completely different part of the program.

## Types of Pointers

*  **void *** is a type that can point to anything

* Use **void *** sparingly to help avoid programs bugs,  and security issues, and other bad thing

* U can have pointers to pointers

* U can even have pointers to functions...

  ```C
  int (*fn)(void *,void *) = &foo
  // fn is a function that accepts two void* pointers and returns an int
  // and initially pointing to the function foo
  // (*fn)(x,y) will then call the function 
  ```

## More C Pointer Dangers

* Declaring a pointer just allocates space to hold the pointer-it does not allocate the thing being pointed to.
* Local variables in C are not initialized, they may contain anything.
