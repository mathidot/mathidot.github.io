​	CPUs provide a special instruction that switches the CPU from user mode to supervisor mode and enters the kernel at an entry point specified by the kernel.(RISC-V provides the `ecall` instruction for this purpose.) Once the CPU has switched to supervisor mode, the kernel can then validate the arguments of the system call(e.g.,check if the address passed to the system call is part of the application's memory),decide whether the application is allowed to perform the requested operation(e.g., check if the applications is allowed to write the specified file), and then deny it or execute it. It is important that the kernel control the kernel entry point, a malicious application could, for example, enter the kernel at a point where the validation of arguments is skipped.
